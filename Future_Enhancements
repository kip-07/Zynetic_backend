## Framework Alternatives

### Express.js Instead of NestJS

While NestJS provides a strong structured framework with many built-in features, it might be beneficial to migrate to Express.js for:

- **Reduced overhead**: Express is more lightweight and has better performance for simpler APIs
- **Wider community support**: Express has a larger community and more examples available
- **Simpler learning curve**: Express is less opinionated and easier for new team members to understand
- **Lower abstraction level**: Gives more direct control over request/response handling
## Database Enhancements

### MongoDB Indexing Optimizations

- Add compound indexes for frequently filtered fields (author, category, rating)
- Add text index on book title for improved search performance
- Implement TTL (Time To Live) index for user tokens

### Database Migration System

- Implement a migration system to manage database schema changes
- Consider tools like MongoDB Migrations or Mongoose Migrations
### Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
- Add per-user quotas for book creation
